因應 [羅素悖論] 這個 [數學危機] ， [希爾伯特計劃] 的主要目標，是為全部的數學提供一個安全的理論基礎。具體地，這個基礎應該包括：

所有數學的形式化。意思是，所有數學應該用一種統一的嚴格形式化的語言，並且按照一套嚴格的規則來使用。
完備性。我們必須證明以下命題：在形式化之後，數學裡所有的真命題都可以被證明（根據上述規則）。

* 一致性。我們必須證明：運用這一套形式化和它的規則，不可能推導出矛盾。

* 保守性。我們需要證明：如果某個關於「實際物」的結論用到了「假想物」（如不可數集合）來證明，那麼不用「假想物」的話我們依然可以證明同樣的結論。

* 確定性。應該有一個算法，來確定每一個形式化的命題是真命題還是假命題。

In mathematics, the Erlangen program is a method of characterizing geometries based on group theory and projective geometry. It was published by Felix Klein in 1872 as Vergleichende Betrachtungen über neuere geometrische Forschungen. It is named after the University Erlangen-Nürnberg, where Klein worked.

By 1872, non-Euclidean geometries had emerged, but without a way to determine their hierarchy and relationships. Klein's method was fundamentally innovative in three ways:

Projective geometry was emphasized as the unifying frame for all other geometries considered by him. In particular, Euclidean geometry was more restrictive than affine geometry, which in turn is more restrictive than projective geometry.
Klein proposed that group theory, a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic methods to abstract the idea of symmetry, was the most useful way of organizing geometrical knowledge; at the time it had already been introduced into the theory of equations in the form of Galois theory.

Klein made much more explicit the idea that each geometrical language had its own, appropriate concepts, thus for example projective geometry rightly talked about conic sections, but not about circles or angles because those notions were not invariant under projective transformations (something familiar in geometrical perspective). The way the multiple languages of geometry then came back together could be explained by the way subgroups of a symmetry group related to each other.

Later, Élie Cartan generalized Klein's homogeneous model spaces to Cartan connections on certain principal bundles, which generalized Riemannian geometry.

In representation theory and algebraic number theory, the Langlands program is a web of far-reaching and consequential conjectures about connections between number theory and geometry. Proposed by Robert Langlands (1967, 1970), it seeks to relate Galois groups in algebraic number theory to automorphic forms and representation theory of algebraic groups over local fields and adeles. Widely seen as the single biggest project in modern mathematical research, the Langlands program has been described by Edward Frenkel as "a kind of grand unified theory of mathematics."[1]
